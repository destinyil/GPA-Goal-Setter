1. Planning and Design
Define project requirements and goals.
Create wireframes and mockups for the user interface.
Choose the technology stack (Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js); Backend: Python (Flask or Django); Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL).
2. Setting Up Development Environment
Install necessary development tools and libraries.
Set up version control with Git and create a GitHub repository.
3. Frontend Development
Set up the React.js project.
Create components for:
User input forms (current GPA, desired GPA, course load).
Display of GPA calculations and requirements.
Progress tracking and updates.
Visual analytics (graphs and charts).
Implement state management (using Redux or Context API).
4. Backend Development
Set up the Flask or Django project.
Create API endpoints for:
Inputting and retrieving user data.
Calculating GPA requirements.
Updating progress and grades.
Implement business logic for GPA calculations.
5. Database Management
Design database schema for storing user data and GPA records.
Implement database models and migration scripts.
Set up connections between the backend and the database.
6. Integration
Connect frontend components with backend API endpoints.
Ensure data is correctly sent and received between frontend and backend.
Implement error handling and validation.
7. Testing
Write unit tests for frontend components and backend functions.
Perform integration testing to ensure all parts work together.
Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with potential users.
8. Deployment
Choose a deployment platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
Set up the deployment pipeline.
Deploy the application and ensure it is accessible.
9. Documentation
Write comprehensive documentation for the codebase.
Create user guides and tutorials.
Document API endpoints and their usage.
10. Maintenance and Updates
Monitor the application for any issues or bugs.
Gather user feedback for improvements.
Regularly update the application with new features and enhancements.
